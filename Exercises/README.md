## Exercises

This folder is reserved for **exercises and assignments** that will be shared during the AI Bootcamp.

As new exercises are added, you can expect to find here:

- Short practice tasks linked to specific sessions  
- Longer mini‑projects to consolidate your learning  
- Optional challenges for students who want to go deeper

Unless otherwise specified in class, you can:

- Create your own notebook or script for each exercise in this folder (or in a subfolder), and  
- Name files clearly (for example: `exercise1_solution_yourname.ipynb`).

Check this folder regularly for updates as the bootcamp progresses.
