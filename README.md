 # AI Bootcamp – Teccom

Welcome to the **AI Bootcamp** repository. This repo contains the learning materials and in-class resources that accompany the bootcamp described in the event brochure.

The brochure in this repo (`Brochure.pdf`) gives you the high-level overview of the event (goals, audience, schedule, and topics). This `README` focuses on helping you **navigate the repository** and use the materials effectively.

## Repository structure

- **`Presentations/`**  
  - Slides used during the sessions and the syllabus.

- **`In-Class-Code/`**  
  - Notebooks and code examples written or demonstrated live during the bootcamp.  
  - Use these to **experiment, run, and modify code** as you follow along or revise.
  - Execute the cells, read the comments, and try small modifications to deepen your understanding.

- **`Exercises/`**  
  - This folder will contain practice exercises, assignments, and extra problems shared during the bootcamp.  
  - Check here regularly for new material to work on between or after classes.

## Requirements and tools

To run the notebooks, you will typically need:

- **Python 3.x**
- A notebook environment such as:
  - Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab, or
  - VS Code / Cursor with the Python extension
- Common data science / AI libraries (exact requirements may depend on each notebook).

If you encounter missing libraries when running a notebook, install them with `pip` or `conda` as indicated in the notebook or by the error messages.
