 # AI Bootcamp – Teccom

Welcome to the **AI Bootcamp** repository. This repo contains the learning materials and in-class resources that accompany the bootcamp described in the event brochure.

The brochure in this repo (`Brochure.pdf`) gives you the high-level overview of the event (goals, audience, schedule, and topics). This `README` focuses on helping you **navigate the repository** and use the materials effectively.

## Repository structure

- **`Presentations/`**  
  - Slide decks and syllabus used during the sessions.  
  - Start here if you want to **review the theory** or see what was covered in each class.

- **`In-Class-Code/`**  
  - Notebooks and code examples written or demonstrated live during the bootcamp.  
  - Use these to **experiment, run, and modify code** as you follow along or revise.

- **`Exercises/`**  
  - This folder will contain practice exercises, assignments, and extra problems shared during the bootcamp.  
  - Check here regularly for new material to work on between or after classes.

- **`Brochure.pdf`**  
  - The official event brochure with a summary of the bootcamp, objectives, and schedule.

## How to use this repository

1. **Read the brochure**  
   - Open `Brochure.pdf` to understand the overall structure of the bootcamp, the main topics, and the expected prerequisites.

2. **Follow the syllabus and slides**  
   - Open the documents in `Presentations/` in order (for example, start with `Ai Bootcamp Syllabus.docx`, then `Class 1.pptx`, etc.).  
   - Use them as your roadmap through the sessions.

3. **Run the notebooks and code**  
   - Go to `In-Class-Code/` and open the notebooks (e.g. `Week1.ipynb`) in Jupyter, VS Code, or any compatible environment.  
   - Execute the cells, read the comments, and try small modifications to deepen your understanding.

4. **Study workflow suggestion**
   - For each session:
     1. Skim the relevant part of `Brochure.pdf` to know the topic and goal.  
     2. Open the matching presentation in `Presentations/`.  
     3. Work through the corresponding notebook(s) in `In-Class-Code/`.  
     4. Take your own notes and save extra notebooks alongside the originals if you wish.

## Requirements and tools

To run the notebooks, you will typically need:

- **Python 3.x**
- A notebook environment such as:
  - Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab, or
  - VS Code / Cursor with the Python extension
- Common data science / AI libraries (exact requirements may depend on each notebook).

If you encounter missing libraries when running a notebook, install them with `pip` or `conda` as indicated in the notebook or by the error messages.

## Questions and improvements

If you are a student in the bootcamp:

- Bring your questions to the live sessions, or  
- Note down which notebook and cell you were running so issues can be reproduced easily.

This repository will evolve as we add more sessions and materials, so check back regularly or pull the latest changes if you have cloned it.
